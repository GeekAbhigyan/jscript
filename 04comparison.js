//try to compare between the same datatypes 

console.log("2">1); // automatially converts into numbers
console.log("02">1);

//comparison between null and zero

console.log(null>0);
console.log(null==0);
console.log(null >=0);


// == and >= work differently

// wheres == , > ,  < treats null as NaN
// >= treat null as 0 and then give the answer 

//==only checks for value 

// === also checks for the datatype as well
